 # Description
 This assignment was heavy on demonstrating concept understanding about Express.js Server. I had to very closely and repeatedly refrence the module 11 lessons. It involved revision of the concepts of using, turning on & turning off express.js server, handle get + post requests on insomnia and revisit Heroku documentation in detail.

 I divided assignment into 3 parts:

 1. Getting good handle on working knowledge of technologies needed by practicing commands.
 2. Creating get routes, post routes on insomnia.
 3. Finally coding for connecting with provided front end files, middleware, add endpoints, modularize the code and tested it many times, prior to deployment on Heroku.
